Simple operating systems simulation with priority interrupts, paging, external device queuing (C-Look algorithm for disk queueing), CPU usage statistics. 

This was my first time doing a project in C.  I tried to apply OOP design principles. To the nay sayers: you don't necessarily need a language with all the bells and whistles of OOP to do OOP, it's more of a design methodology. And it worked quite well for this assignment. Developed this project using Valgrind and GDB; glad to say that there are zero memory leaks in the program (If the program is exited with 'Q' at the command line, although I think I may have set it up to clean up memory on a CTRL-D action as well). 

When I get the opportunity I will return to this project to reverse engineer how it works again (It's been a while), and provide an instruction sheet, as well as fix a bug in the page table.
